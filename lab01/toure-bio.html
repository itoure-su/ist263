        My name is Ibrahim Toure. My current major is undecided, but I intend on joining the iSchool and concentrating on data analytics. When it comes to data analytics I found interest in it because of the upperclassmen friends that I have in the same field. I found working with software really interesting and it has always been one of my favorite things to study. When it comes to accomplishments, I've achieved a principal's list for a whole grade year and honor roll for 2 grade years as well. I am an avid basketball player and I have a 6th man award and scholar athlete of the year award. I also have the best Student of AP Government, a 5 on AP Calc and a 4 on AP Biology. Outside of class, I am a Syracuse Club Basketball team player and I love to play basketball and spend time with friends. I love watching movies and  basketball games as well.
